The module file system is assigned to the variable fs -> 'const fs = require('fs')'

fs.writeFileSync('file.name', 'data to write') creates or overwrites that file

fs.appendFileSync('file.name', 'data to write') adds data to the end of that file

adding \n at the end of the data causes the next addition on a new line

You can link to your own files by providing the relative path ie. require()./fileName.js

Each individual file has it's own scope so variables do not cross file bounderies

You can 'explicitly' export variables from one file to another via module.exports = variable in the sending file

To use the data from module.exports, the receiving file must have const variable = require('relative path to exporting file')
