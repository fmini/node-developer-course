The module file system is assigned to the variable fs -> 'const fs = require('fs')'

fs.writeFileSync('file.name', 'data to write') creates or overwrites that file

fs.appendFileSync('file.name', 'data to write') adds data to the end of that file

adding \n at the end of the data causes the next addition on a new line
